== Known Issues ==
* Google won't recursively let you pull all results of a search
* No guarantee that files will be downloaded (doesn't account for 404 errors)
* Amount does not represent the amount of files to be downloaded directly
* Google will suspect abuse if queried too fast, too often

== Plans ==
* Add in annonymous downloaded (trick Google)
* Check the amount and pad when needed
* Guarentee file download or error
* Recursively go through Google results to get the most amount of files
